my name is guy zohar.

i hope you enjoy the rest of my uploads
most of them are just excersises in app design but i think i still have some ruby on rails stuff from a while back
also if you want to check out my better works(the programming not the user interfaces...), then i have 2 links on my CV directing you 
to my best 2 projects.

enjoy.
